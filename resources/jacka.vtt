0:00:04.000 --> 0:00:06.000
<v Bob Neal> Its on

2
0:00:06.000 --> 0:00:12.000
<v Laura Nohr> I saw that yellow dog, I think its Jerry's dog its a little bit of a thing.

3
0:00:12.000 --> 0:00:16.000
<v Bob Neal> No, I think that's Ben Lieder's.
<v Laura Nohr> Oh, Ben's dog maybe. I don't know. Anyway, it came through.

4
0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:17.000
<v Bob Neal> Cute little thing, isn't it.

5
0:00:17.000 --> 0:00:26.000
<v Laura Nohr> Cute and came barking, you know, and she turned right around and she stood her ground. She never moved.

6
0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:28.000
<v Bob Neal> Was it a male or a female?

7
0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:31.000
<v Laura Nohr> I didn't know that it was over.

8
0:00:31.000 --> 0:00:36.000
<v Bob Neal> Standing up here on the steps and Pat was looking at it and the poor little thing was so scared. And did you see it when you came?

9
0:00:36.000 --> 0:00:42.000
<v Laura Nohr> No, I didn't. Hold on.

10
0:00:42.000 --> 0:00:46.000
<v Bob Neal> No little dog out there? Little tiny collar on it.
<v Laura Nohr> A little dog. Very tiny. I thought it was a cat at first.

11
0:00:46.000 --> 0:01:13.000
<v Bob Neal> What did you say about this candy?
<v Laura Nohr> Well Louise and Frank always bring a three pound box of these and their friends, they call it ambrosia. Food for the gods, you see. Ambrosia, you'll see. Food for the gods made in Milwaukee and um, so it was supposed to be divided between me and Carl. You see, because it comes in either

12
0:01:13.000 --> 0:01:40.000
<v Bob Neal> big slabs.
<v Laura Nohr> Yeah, big slabs. So they said, well now you eat it and I came off in a hurry, with Edgar, you know, he went down, I forgot all about it and um, I really didn't think any more about it. And now when I came down, you know, Carl says I can't eat chocolate. So, uh, I have taken them about half of one of the slabs that she had given to Pete.

13
0:01:40.000 --> 0:02:07.000
<v Bob Neal> You should use some.
<v Laura Nohr> Give them a taste, you know, and she said, now you just take the rest of this home. I said my goodness you haven't used up more. No, not a pound of it, not half a half a pound. And she said, well now you give Pendarvis a taste of it so they know and then you give Georgia a taste and then you keep the other half for yourself. I said Okay. If you're not gonna use it.

14
0:02:07.000 --> 0:02:08.000
<v Edgar Hellum> This was too much to give up.

15
0:02:08.000 --> 0:02:17.000
<v Laura Nohr> No take it, and bake it. You can put it in with your English toffee, it breaks, you have to break it that way.

16
0:02:17.000 --> 0:02:21.000
<v Edgar Hellum> If you have any of that English toffee left its out there underneath those tablecloths. I forgot it was still there.

17
0:02:21.000 --> 0:02:22.000
<v Laura Nohr> Is there some left?

18
0:02:22.000 --> 0:02:23.000
<v Edgar Hellum> Yeah, You want a piece?

19
0:02:23.000 --> 0:02:28.000
<v Laura Nohr> No, no thank you. I just had a big piece of this.

20
0:02:28.000 --> 0:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1> [inaudible]

21
0:02:34.000 --> 0:02:36.000
<v Edgar Hellum> Bob says we can, they just set it on a coffee table.

22
0:02:36.000 --> 0:02:37.000
<v Laura Nohr> Yeah,

23
0:02:37.000 --> 0:02:39.000
<v Edgar Hellum> And it picks up all the room.
<v Laura Nohr> That's what this woman did.

24
0:02:39.000 --> 0:02:56.000
<v Mrs Jacka> He, she um, she um, prepared things for the blind and she never held it. She put it right on the table and, and she just did what she had prepared. She had notes, you know, she just simply sat and read and then those things were sent.

25
0:02:56.000 --> 0:03:14.000
<v Bob Neal> It's a nuisance of this kind of microphone to hold it over for one person to speak and then hold it over for another. This one we can, if it works this way, just setting it on the table.

26
0:03:14.000 --> 0:03:16.000
<v Laura Nohr> Well I think its as clear as anything.

27
0:03:16.000 --> 0:03:34.000
<v Bob Neal> We're recording now. I want to see what it does now with uh, all of us gathered around here. How far are you? You must be five, six feet away. Nobody's, nobody's raising their voices, Laura, you know?

28
0:03:34.000 --> 0:03:35.000
<v Laura Nohr> I didn't know you were recording.

29
0:03:35.000 --> 0:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1> Okay. [inaudible]

30
0:03:55.000 --> 0:04:07.000
<v Laura Nohr> Oh, mom,

31
0:04:07.000 --> 0:04:10.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I've even forgotten that fellow's name.

32
0:04:10.000 --> 0:04:14.000
<v Bob Neal> What fellows name?
<v Edgar Hellum> My name?

33
0:04:14.000 --> 0:04:19.000
<v Laura Nohr> No, she's talkin' about, that uh.
<v Edgar Hellum> You know my name.

34
0:04:19.000 --> 0:04:21.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I don't know what his name is now.

35
0:04:21.000 --> 0:04:28.000
<v Laura Nohr> the French man. That's the, uh, that makes the pottery.

36
0:04:28.000 --> 0:04:31.000
<v Bob Neal> Did I ask you who that was?

37
0:04:31.000 --> 0:04:35.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I think I've seen that picture before but I didn't

38
0:04:35.000 --> 0:04:36.000
<v Bob Neal> you didn't remember who it was?

39
0:04:36.000 --> 0:04:37.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No, I didn't.

40
0:04:37.000 --> 0:04:45.000
<v Bob Neal> That's the one that, um, Bertha Bauer told me to take good care of. I put it in that case.

41
0:04:45.000 --> 0:04:47.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Who'd she say was,

42
0:04:47.000 --> 0:04:48.000
<v Bob Neal> She didn't say,

43
0:04:48.000 --> 0:04:50.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh, she just thought the style of it.

44
0:04:50.000 --> 0:04:56.000
<v Bob Neal> Do you know who that is?

45
0:04:56.000 --> 0:04:57.000
<v Mrs Jacka> That's Mrs Hood.
<v Bob Neal> Do you remember her?

46
0:04:57.000 --> 0:04:58.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yes.

47
0:04:58.000 --> 0:05:00.000
<v Bob Neal> You do?

48
0:05:00.000 --> 0:05:03.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Um hmm.
<v Bob Neal> That's, that's the, um,

49
0:05:03.000 --> 0:05:04.000
<v Mrs Jacka> That's really a picture of her.

50
0:05:04.000 --> 0:05:07.000
<v Bob Neal> That's the same picture. This picture here.

51
0:05:07.000 --> 0:05:08.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah. That's a good picture of her, too.

52
0:05:08.000 --> 0:05:18.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, I wondered whether this might be Mrs. Hood at an older age.

53
0:05:18.000 --> 0:05:26.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, I think she's a stronger featured woman, this woman is. She looks, see how large her face is.

54
0:05:26.000 --> 0:05:33.000
<v Bob Neal> But her hair is parted the same way. This must be quite a young person. This picture of Mrs. Hood.

55
0:05:33.000 --> 0:05:40.000
<v Mrs Jacka> That's Mrs. Hood. I just remember seeing her and that dog.

56
0:05:40.000 --> 0:05:45.000
<v Bob Neal> That's a sweet little hat she's got on there. You notice all the little flowers.

57
0:05:45.000 --> 0:05:51.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Isn't that good.
<v Bob Neal> Look at all the little flowers around the head. She looks there as though she was a,

58
0:05:51.000 --> 0:05:54.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I bet Bertha never saw her,

59
0:05:54.000 --> 0:05:56.000
<v Bob Neal> But George Masten says that he remembers Mrs. Hood.

60
0:05:56.000 --> 0:05:59.000
<v Mrs Jacka> oh, yes, he would.

61
0:05:59.000 --> 0:06:24.000
<v Bob Neal> I want to show them to George Masten sometime. And he said he remembered the house down there, the little uh, little frame house there where the filling station is, he said, he said it had a little picket fence around it. As a boy he used to remember that. But that.

62
0:06:24.000 --> 0:06:31.000
<v Mrs Jacka> They had a, um, a blacksmith shop there. Mastens did.
<v Bob Neal> Right in Hood's back yard.

63
0:06:31.000 --> 0:06:32.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yes, right there.

64
0:06:32.000 --> 0:06:44.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, this is the, this picture I had been looking for since, I don't know when and it was used, this is the Centennial booklet that was used.

65
0:06:44.000 --> 0:07:05.000
<v Mrs Jacka> That's the picture.
<v Bob Neal> That was 1927 and this is 1958. So that's 31 years that that's been in hiding. And I, I really thought that the picture was lost. I had never been able to find a picture of Mrs. Hood.

66
0:07:05.000 --> 0:07:09.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Where did you find it?
<v Bob Neal> Jeanette Terrell,

67
0:07:09.000 --> 0:07:22.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh!
<v Laura Nohr> Oh for gracious sakes.
<v Bob Neal> She got it from Lizzie Terrell and Lizzie Terrell got it from old Mrs. Will Terrell, her mother. Evidently. Mrs.

68
0:07:22.000 --> 0:07:29.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well you see Rablins were ah connected with the Terrells.

69
0:07:29.000 --> 0:07:48.000
<v Bob Neal> The Rablins. Was Mrs Will Terrell a Rablin? Was she Lizzie Rablin? No, not Lizzie. Um, what did Jeanette say her grandmother's name was? Let's see, Mark Terrill and Lizzie Terrell were brother and sister weren't they?

70
0:07:48.000 --> 0:07:51.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yes, um hmm.
<v Bob Neal> and Lizzie's mother and father were.

71
0:07:51.000 --> 0:07:54.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Rablins.
<v Bob Neal> Was she a Rablin?

72
0:07:54.000 --> 0:07:55.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I think so.

73
0:07:55.000 --> 0:07:59.000
<v Bob Neal> And she married Will Terrell?

74
0:07:59.000 --> 0:08:06.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Um hmm.
<v Bob Neal> Well it was Mrs Will Terrell that got that picture originally.

75
0:08:06.000 --> 0:08:10.000
<v Bob Neal> It isn't that, isn't that an excellent picture?

76
0:08:10.000 --> 0:08:12.000
<v Mrs Jacka> It's around here.

77
0:08:12.000 --> 0:08:25.000
<v Bob Neal> I, uh, I put it in this little case I had, I had some of these cases and I took the, uh, I took the other picture in here out.

78
0:08:25.000 --> 0:08:30.000
<v Mrs Jacka> They call those daguerreotypes.
<v Bob Neal> Daguerreotypes, yeah.
<v Mrs Jacka> Will has a picture of my father that they took, a daguerreotype.

79
0:08:30.000 --> 0:08:31.000
<v Bob Neal> Who took it? Do you remember?

80
0:08:31.000 --> 0:08:33.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh no, I.

81
0:08:33.000 --> 0:08:38.000
<v Bob Neal> Wouldn't be a Moffitt.

82
0:08:38.000 --> 0:09:15.000
<v Mrs Jacka> It was earlier than that.
<v Bob Neal> Moffitt took one picture of governor Dodge that I have in 1858. That's exactly a hundred years ago. And he was a, I've got an old Mineral Point store directory and there's an ad in there, says that CP Moffitt, daguerreotype artist, and this was 1857 or 59. I've forgotten which, but I'd like know who that that person was. That's the one that, uh, as I said, Mrs. Bauer told me to, uh, to save.

83
0:09:15.000 --> 0:09:17.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I wonder if she knew who it was.

84
0:09:17.000 --> 0:09:38.000
<v Bob Neal> She said, Mark this Important, put it away. Don't leave it with the rest of them. But you never told me who it was, whether she, whether she knew. You think she would've said, wouldn't you, that if she'd have known who it was. Isn't that an excellent picture?

85
0:09:38.000 --> 0:09:47.000
<v Mrs Jacka> He lived at the foot of Rablin's Hill. I don't know whether it stands there or not. Or not.

86
0:09:47.000 --> 0:09:53.000
<v Edgar Hellum> Rablin's house opposite McSherry's you mean on the other side of the ravine?

87
0:09:53.000 --> 0:09:59.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah on the other side of the road.
<v Edgar Hellum> Well you know the only house that's there now is that house where ah Fred Branger lived, you know that rock house,

88
0:09:59.000 --> 0:10:02.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well this is on the other hill.

89
0:10:02.000 --> 0:10:24.000
<v Edgar Hellum> You mean John Manley's house? Oh, or you mean the other way over toward the, uh, John C. H. Peter's over in that uh, east of McSherry's. Yes, I know where you mean. Well, there's only one or two houses over there. You know, Laura, where

90
0:10:24.000 --> 0:10:26.000
<v Laura Nohr> Mmm Hmm. I know where you mean.

91
0:10:26.000 --> 0:10:31.000
<v Bob Neal> So Mrs Mrs Will Terrell was a Rablin

92
0:10:31.000 --> 0:10:47.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Mark Terrill's wife was a Rablin and Mrs Sam was a Rablin. They were sisters. They were sisters, Mark Terrell's wife and, and uh, and Mrs [inaudible] were sisters.

93
0:10:47.000 --> 0:10:54.000
<v Bob Neal> Well then who was, uh, Will, Will Rablin. Lavinia Rablin. There was a Lavinia Rablin.

94
0:10:54.000 --> 0:10:58.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well that was Mrs James's name, Lavinia

95
0:10:58.000 --> 0:11:01.000
<v Bob Neal> Lavinia?

96
0:11:01.000 --> 0:11:35.000
<v Mrs Jacka> umm hmm.
<v Bob Neal> Mr Gundry told me about, um, an old Mrs Rablin here in Mineral Point, whose husband worked in the mines. And when he would go to work, he would lower her in an old, down into an abandoned mineshaft and she'd sit there all day and knit and so forth. So that she wouldn't be bothered by the Indians. Can you imagine that? Imagine spending the day down in the bottom of a mine shaft, knitting, or sewing or something. Then they'd come back at night and hoist her up.

97
0:11:35.000 --> 0:11:39.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well you see Dave's mother remembered the Indians going through here.

98
0:11:39.000 --> 0:11:42.000
<v Laura Nohr> Oh, yes. I've heard her tell about the Indians.

99
0:11:42.000 --> 0:11:48.000
<v Edgar Hellum> Well, they were, they were friendly. They were begging, though, weren't they? Begging, always begging.

100
0:11:48.000 --> 0:11:51.000
<v Mrs Jacka> They had beaded work to sell, too.

101
0:11:51.000 --> 0:12:10.000
<v Edgar Hellum> But they always wanted flour, meat or, uh, all, always begging.

102
0:12:10.000 --> 0:12:14.000
<v Bob Neal> Mrs. Hood came from Georgia.

103
0:12:14.000 --> 0:12:16.000
<v Laura Nohr> Mrs. Hood came from Georgia, Bob said.

104
0:12:16.000 --> 0:12:27.000
<v Bob Neal> She was a southerner. She looks sort of Indian there don't you Think? Sort of the high cheekbones. Did you know any of the Hood children?

105
0:12:27.000 --> 0:12:29.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Any of the what?

106
0:12:29.000 --> 0:12:31.000
<v Laura Nohr> Any of the Hood children?

107
0:12:31.000 --> 0:12:33.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No. Did she have any children?

108
0:12:33.000 --> 0:12:39.000
<v Bob Neal> Yes. Yes.

109
0:12:39.000 --> 0:12:54.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I never knew her to have any.
<v Bob Neal> Well, one of her daughters had this, uh, one of the, son Sam Hood that used to correspond with Johnny Francis. In fact, I have the letters that said.

110
0:12:54.000 --> 0:12:56.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Wasn't that her husband's name? Sam?

111
0:12:56.000 --> 0:13:02.000
<v Bob Neal> No, John. John. He died in 1844.

112
0:13:02.000 --> 0:13:07.000
<v Laura Nohr> Her husband.
<v Bob Neal> Her husband, Mrs Hood's husband, John Hood, died in 1844.

113
0:13:07.000 --> 0:13:11.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, I never remember anybody around there but her.

114
0:13:11.000 --> 0:13:14.000
<v Bob Neal> She must've been elderly.

115
0:13:14.000 --> 0:13:17.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I never remember any men.

116
0:13:17.000 --> 0:13:18.000
<v Bob Neal> or any, any children?

117
0:13:18.000 --> 0:13:21.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No, no children.

118
0:13:21.000 --> 0:13:25.000
<v Laura Nohr> How old were you when you remember her? around there.

119
0:13:25.000 --> 0:13:31.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, when we moved down there I was about six years old.

120
0:13:31.000 --> 0:13:35.000
<v Laura Nohr> I mean a child six wouldn't.

121
0:13:35.000 --> 0:13:42.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, you uh, do you remember her as being an old lady?

122
0:13:42.000 --> 0:13:43.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Just about like this.

123
0:13:43.000 --> 0:13:47.000
<v Bob Neal> You do.

124
0:13:47.000 --> 0:13:53.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Just about like you see her here.
<v Bob Neal> Because that strikes me as rather a young looking picture.

125
0:13:53.000 --> 0:13:57.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, of course you can't tell what she might have put on.

126
0:13:57.000 --> 0:14:04.000
<v Bob Neal> They probably got all dressed up to have their pictures taken.

127
0:14:04.000 --> 0:14:06.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Sure, well that was just it.
<v Bob Neal> Well, I've never come across any other pictures in all of the pictures I've seen.

128
0:14:06.000 --> 0:14:09.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I never saw another picture of inaudible.

129
0:14:09.000 --> 0:14:14.000
<v Bob Neal> I think that's quite a, quite a find to get that.

130
0:14:14.000 --> 0:14:20.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I think so, too.
<v Bob Neal> Because otherwise it could be lost forever.

131
0:14:20.000 --> 0:14:23.000
<v Mrs Jacka> My, but she's a strong featured woman, this woman.

132
0:14:23.000 --> 0:14:28.000
<v Bob Neal> I'll have to show that to Mrs Bauer and ask her.

133
0:14:28.000 --> 0:14:29.000
<v Laura Nohr> Where did that come from? Where did you pick this up?

134
0:14:29.000 --> 0:14:32.000
<v Bob Neal> I don't remember where I got it.

135
0:14:32.000 --> 0:14:33.000
<v Laura Nohr> I thought maybe you might trace it.

136
0:14:33.000 --> 0:14:49.000
<v Bob Neal> I remember where I got it. But do you remember that afternoon that you and Harry were out there? There's a bar and I showed her that and she said get an envelope, put it in there, mark it important. And uh, I'll have to, to uh, show it to her and ask her if she knows who it is. Maybe George Masten might know, too.

137
0:14:49.000 --> 0:14:53.000
<v Laura Nohr> Is he still living?

138
0:14:53.000 --> 0:15:06.000
<v Edgar Hellum> Ed Graber tells me that he'll go down to Darlington with me when, uh, I go down to visit with George. He likes to go down and see him and he says George is just in perfect health.

139
0:15:06.000 --> 0:15:08.000
<v Laura Nohr> George Masten is in perfect health.

140
0:15:08.000 --> 0:15:09.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh, he lives in Darlington with somebody.

141
0:15:09.000 --> 0:15:11.000
<v Laura Nohr> mmm hmm. I know.

142
0:15:11.000 --> 0:15:15.000
<v Bob Neal> I think he's what, 93 or 94 ?

143
0:15:15.000 --> 0:15:23.000
<v Mrs Jacka> He went to live with the people he lived with in Darlington when he first went there. So I've heard.

144
0:15:23.000 --> 0:15:39.000
<v Bob Neal> He has a birthday. Uh, his birthday's in February or March, so he's probably turning 93 or 94 this year. And he has an excellent memory, particularly about the tornado.

145
0:15:39.000 --> 0:15:49.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Is that right.
<v Bob Neal> He remembers the tornado of 78 so well and of course so does Bertha Bauer. She was, she was telling me about it.

146
0:15:49.000 --> 0:15:53.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, I remember going around and seeing the ruins.

147
0:15:53.000 --> 0:15:54.000
<v Bob Neal> After, after the tornado.
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah. Afterwards, that's all.

148
0:15:54.000 --> 0:15:57.000
<v Laura Nohr> Were are you in school? When it hit?

149
0:15:57.000 --> 0:16:00.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yes, umm hmm.

150
0:16:00.000 --> 0:16:02.000
<v Bob Neal> Did they dismiss school?

151
0:16:02.000 --> 0:16:09.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, see, I'd have been eight years old. I was born in '70.

152
0:16:09.000 --> 0:16:10.000
<v Laura Nohr> Did they dismiss school?

153
0:16:10.000 --> 0:16:12.000
<v Mrs Jacka> They did?

154
0:16:12.000 --> 0:16:15.000
<v Laura Nohr> I've heard dad say they did.

155
0:16:15.000 --> 0:16:24.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, he remembers about it because he went and saw the homes. Their home was blown out into the street.

156
0:16:24.000 --> 0:16:31.000
<v Bob Neal> What do you remember about the tornado? Just seeing the buildings that were wrecked?

157
0:16:31.000 --> 0:16:33.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I remember the brewery more than anything.

158
0:16:33.000 --> 0:16:43.000
<v Bob Neal> yeah, there's some excellent pictures of, uh, of the Gilman's brewery after it was all demolished and the trees down

159
0:16:43.000 --> 0:16:45.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Everything out there was just demolished.

160
0:16:45.000 --> 0:16:49.000
<v Laura Nohr> I've heard dad say that some old man.

161
0:16:49.000 --> 0:16:50.000
<v Mrs Jacka> That was Toay. Donnie Toay.

162
0:16:50.000 --> 0:17:01.000
<v Laura Nohr> who was a character. Told him as he was coming out of the school house, that all his people had been killed in the tornado and he went home crying.

163
0:17:01.000 --> 0:17:05.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, I think he took him home.

164
0:17:05.000 --> 0:17:09.000
<v Bob Neal> Who was that? Tip Allen?
<v Mrs Jacka> No, one of the Toays.

165
0:17:09.000 --> 0:17:20.000
<v Bob Neal> One of the Toays. When you said a character Laura, only character I could think of, you remember Tip Allen? Wasn't he a character.

166
0:17:20.000 --> 0:17:23.000
<v Laura Nohr> Maybe that's who told dad that?

167
0:17:23.000 --> 0:17:26.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No, it was Toay.

168
0:17:26.000 --> 0:17:31.000
<v Laura Nohr> I know, but I mean, I don't think he'd tell him that and take him home, you know? Do you,

169
0:17:31.000 --> 0:17:41.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh, I don't know.
<v Laura Nohr> I heard dad say it was some old funny fella. Some old character. Maybe the Toay took him home afterwards.

170
0:17:41.000 --> 0:17:44.000
<v Mrs Jacka> It was some Toay that wanted to adopt him.

171
0:17:44.000 --> 0:17:53.000
<v Laura Nohr> To adopt Dad? They must have done a lot of that in those days.

172
0:17:53.000 --> 0:17:57.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well he was quite a good looking youngster. David was a good looking kid.

173
0:17:57.000 --> 0:18:03.000
<v Bob Neal> But what was the matter with his parents?

174
0:18:03.000 --> 0:18:06.000
<v Mrs Jacka> They were kind of attached to each other.

175
0:18:06.000 --> 0:18:12.000
<v Bob Neal> this old man?

176
0:18:12.000 --> 0:18:21.000
<v Laura Nohr> They probably used to say that to be nice to a kid.

177
0:18:21.000 --> 0:18:32.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Jim Toay, was it old Jim Toay? Johnny? Who lived where the Petersons lived years ago?

178
0:18:32.000 --> 0:18:49.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, let's see. Um, yes. Uh, Mary Holzmiller's grandfather wasn't, wasn't, was he a Toay? She was married Toay, wasn't she?

179
0:18:49.000 --> 0:18:52.000
<v Laura Nohr> Mrs Holzmiller was Mary Toay?

180
0:18:52.000 --> 0:18:57.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yes, but this was a relative, but it wasn't.

181
0:18:57.000 --> 0:19:09.000
<v Bob Neal> Was it a Hockings? It wasn't the Hockings? You remember Mrs Hocking lived there?

182
0:19:09.000 --> 0:19:24.000
<v Mrs Jacka> It was Mrs Hockings' father. What was Mrs. Hockings' name before she was married?

183
0:19:24.000 --> 0:19:28.000
<v Bob Neal> I can't help you out on that.

184
0:19:28.000 --> 0:19:32.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I can't think either.

185
0:19:32.000 --> 0:19:42.000
<v Bob Neal> Did I ever ask you and you know, one time when we were talking about the Klais pottery, whether you remember any children that Mr. Klais had?

186
0:19:42.000 --> 0:19:44.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No, there was never anybody around.

187
0:19:44.000 --> 0:20:24.000
<v Bob Neal> I thought there was a, I sort of have in the back of my mind that somebody by the name of Alice Klais, somebody other from Racine years ago came down to see the old house. This was, this was maybe at the time of the Centennial, maybe 30 years ago. And, nobody ever definitely contacted her to know where she lived or anything about it. So, that's the only clue that I have that Klais had any children. Well of course he must have had a wife. Did you ever, was she ever, did she ever help?

188
0:20:24.000 --> 0:20:28.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No, I never saw a woman around there. Just this man.

189
0:20:28.000 --> 0:20:30.000
<v Bob Neal> All by himself?

190
0:20:30.000 --> 0:20:37.000
<v Mrs Jacka> And he'd be outside working in the shed, you know, kind of a shed- like affair.

191
0:20:37.000 --> 0:20:41.000
<v Bob Neal> Was he all covered with clay and, and different [inaudible]

192
0:20:41.000 --> 0:20:44.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well he'd mold it with his hands.

193
0:20:44.000 --> 0:20:51.000
<v Bob Neal> Spin the table, the wheel?
<v Mrs Jacka> No, I never saw anything of that kind. He'd just mold it with his hands.

194
0:20:51.000 --> 0:20:58.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, he made the what did he make? Mostly flower pots or crocks, crockery ware?

195
0:20:58.000 --> 0:21:07.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah. Crockery. Jars.
<v Bob Neal> Well, did he have a horse in the yard that stirred up the clay to mix it up?

196
0:21:07.000 --> 0:21:12.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No, mm hmm.
<v Bob Neal> Well, did you ever see where he, uh fired the, the things that he made? The furnace?

197
0:21:12.000 --> 0:21:17.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No. He was just molding it with his hands.

198
0:21:17.000 --> 0:21:22.000
<v Laura Nohr> Mother was quite young. How old were you? You were only about six, weren't you?

199
0:21:22.000 --> 0:21:25.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I was probably five.

200
0:21:25.000 --> 0:21:28.000
<v Bob Neal> Well that's uh, that's, that's pretty young.

201
0:21:28.000 --> 0:21:38.000
<v Laura Nohr> She wouldn't notice things like that.
<v Bob Neal> You'd think there would be somebody around to help him, but he evidently he worked all by himself.

202
0:21:38.000 --> 0:21:46.000
<v Laura Nohr> Mother said, you said that you used to go up there and sit and watch, just like a kid would, was interested in things like that.

203
0:21:46.000 --> 0:21:50.000
<v Bob Neal> Was he a nice man? I mean he didn't chase you away.

204
0:21:50.000 --> 0:21:54.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No.
<v Bob Neal> Tell you get out of his way or

205
0:21:54.000 --> 0:21:56.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No. He was a short, stocky fella.

206
0:21:56.000 --> 0:21:57.000
<v Bob Neal> I wonder what nationality he was. Klais.

207
0:21:57.000 --> 0:22:04.000
<v Laura Nohr> Nationality. What nationality.

208
0:22:04.000 --> 0:22:07.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I wouldn't know anything about that.

209
0:22:07.000 --> 0:22:10.000
<v Bob Neal> I don't suppose he was a Cornishman?

210
0:22:10.000 --> 0:22:14.000
<v Mrs Jacka> French? But isn't that a French name?
<v Bob Neal> I don't even know how it was spelled.

211
0:22:14.000 --> 0:22:16.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I don't either.

212
0:22:16.000 --> 0:22:17.000
<v Bob Neal> I always.

213
0:22:17.000 --> 0:22:19.000
<v Mrs Jacka> It always seemed to me it was French.

214
0:22:19.000 --> 0:22:24.000
<v Bob Neal> I always imagined as being C L A C E but.

215
0:22:24.000 --> 0:22:37.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I always thought there was a Y in it.
<v Bob Neal> somebody said, maybe you did, C L Y C E , but it's a name that's completely disappeared and I've never come.

216
0:22:37.000 --> 0:22:39.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Its a name that's not common at all.

217
0:22:39.000 --> 0:22:47.000
<v Bob Neal> I've never come across it any, any more other than that potter's name.

218
0:22:47.000 --> 0:22:52.000
<v Mrs Jacka> It seemed when he was gone everything there was gone with him.

219
0:22:52.000 --> 0:22:55.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, when would you go over? After school? Or on Saturdays or.

220
0:22:55.000 --> 0:22:58.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I wouldn't be going to school then I don't suppose,

221
0:22:58.000 --> 0:23:03.000
<v Bob Neal> No, I don't suppose they had kindergarten in those days.

222
0:23:03.000 --> 0:23:07.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No.
<v Bob Neal> Well of course you lived right there nearby too.

223
0:23:07.000 --> 0:23:19.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well it wouldn't be far.
<v Bob Neal> Not too far. Who else lived over in that neighborhood? Do you remember the old government spring there? Just below Klaises house?

224
0:23:19.000 --> 0:23:23.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, let's see who, who lived by that spring?

225
0:23:23.000 --> 0:23:26.000
<v Bob Neal> Remember Lizzie Hoffman?

226
0:23:26.000 --> 0:23:27.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Aye.

227
0:23:27.000 --> 0:23:37.000
<v Bob Neal> Or the Cox's? Lizzie Hoffman lived up in, uh, in that house where the

228
0:23:37.000 --> 0:23:49.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I have the name of that woman that lived close to that spring and they called it by her name.

229
0:23:49.000 --> 0:23:54.000
<v Mrs Jacka> It would come to me if I didn't try.

230
0:23:54.000 --> 0:23:58.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, everybody in that neighborhood used to go there for water, didn't they?

231
0:23:58.000 --> 0:24:04.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yes they did.

232
0:24:04.000 --> 0:24:05.000
<v Laura Nohr> Where was that spring, Bob?
<v Bob Neal> Why, Its still there.

233
0:24:05.000 --> 0:24:06.000
<v Laura Nohr> Is it?

234
0:24:06.000 --> 0:24:10.000
<v Bob Neal> Yes, they've got it, it's a closed now and covered over.

235
0:24:10.000 --> 0:24:15.000
<v Mrs Jacka> And also many people used to go there to get their water.

236
0:24:15.000 --> 0:24:17.000
<v Bob Neal> It was the main supply of water.

237
0:24:17.000 --> 0:24:18.000
<v Laura Nohr> Wasn't it the main supply of water?

238
0:24:18.000 --> 0:24:22.000
<v Bob Neal> Everybody got their drinking water there.

239
0:24:22.000 --> 0:24:27.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, apparently, they did.
<v Bob Neal> and that was just below Klaises place there.

240
0:24:27.000 --> 0:24:34.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yes, it was.
<v Bob Neal> I wonder whether he got his water for his pottery and clay there.

241
0:24:34.000 --> 0:24:43.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Right at the foot of the hill. It was right at the foot.
<v Bob Neal> Do you remember that old log and rock house back to the spring?

242
0:24:43.000 --> 0:24:48.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, there was a house there, a log house.

243
0:24:48.000 --> 0:24:51.000
<v Bob Neal> Yes. You don't remember who lived in it?

244
0:24:51.000 --> 0:24:57.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No, that's the name I'm trying to think of.

245
0:24:57.000 --> 0:25:00.000
<v Bob Neal> but was she a lady lived all by herself?

246
0:25:00.000 --> 0:25:05.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yes, she was all by herself.

247
0:25:05.000 --> 0:25:07.000
<v Bob Neal> No, no children or,

248
0:25:07.000 --> 0:25:27.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, I tell you, she had a sis, she had a daughter that married one of the Goldsworthys here. Laura married, Laura Goldsworthy.

249
0:25:27.000 --> 0:25:31.000
<v Bob Neal> No. Laura wouldn't be Laura Goldsworthy.

250
0:25:31.000 --> 0:25:36.000
<v Laura Nohr> no. What would the Goldsworthy's name be? Would it be Laura?

251
0:25:36.000 --> 0:25:37.000
<v Mrs Jacka> He lives here in town.

252
0:25:37.000 --> 0:25:45.000
<v Laura Nohr> Oh. Was their daughter's name Laura, the woman that lived in the log house?

253
0:25:45.000 --> 0:26:01.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No, that was the mother. It wasn't, It wasn't a common name.

254
0:26:01.000 --> 0:26:06.000
<v Laura Nohr> What Goldsworthy did the daughter marry?

255
0:26:06.000 --> 0:26:11.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Related to Tassy Ivey. She was a Goldsworthy

256
0:26:11.000 --> 0:26:14.000
<v Laura Nohr> I didn't know she was a Goldsworthy.

257
0:26:14.000 --> 0:26:16.000
<v Bob Neal> Tassy Ivey? Mrs. Frank Ivey?

258
0:26:16.000 --> 0:26:21.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah. Well her husband

259
0:26:21.000 --> 0:26:26.000
<v Bob Neal> Mrs. Frank Ivey was a Goldsworthy?

260
0:26:26.000 --> 0:26:28.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Her.
<v Bob Neal> I thought she was a Toay.

261
0:26:28.000 --> 0:26:31.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Her father,

262
0:26:31.000 --> 0:26:42.000
<v Bob Neal> Was Tassie Toay.
<v Mrs Jacka> Was it her father or grandfather was a Goldsworthy. Her mother was a Goldsworthy. That's right. Tassie's mother, was a Goldsworthy.

263
0:26:42.000 --> 0:26:45.000
<v Bob Neal> and Goldsworthy married a Toay

264
0:26:45.000 --> 0:26:48.000
<v Laura Nohr> Goldsworthy married a Toay?

265
0:26:48.000 --> 0:26:50.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah.

266
0:26:50.000 --> 0:26:51.000
<v Laura Nohr> Yes, because Tassie was Tassie Toay.

267
0:26:51.000 --> 0:27:15.000
<v Bob Neal> And Tassie, Tassie Toay married Frank Ivey. Yeah. That's the way. Of course Goldsworthy is an old, old name around here. Well, where did you get your drinking water over at the hotel. Did you have a well there?

268
0:27:15.000 --> 0:27:21.000
<v Mrs Jacka> There used to be, down at Argall's brewery, there used to be a spring, too.

269
0:27:21.000 --> 0:27:27.000
<v Bob Neal> Yes. Would you have to carry water from there up to the hotel.

270
0:27:27.000 --> 0:27:33.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, yeah. I don't know they carried all of it, but they carried some.

271
0:27:33.000 --> 0:27:36.000
<v Bob Neal> That was quite a, that was quite a, that was quite a trip.

272
0:27:36.000 --> 0:27:47.000
<v Laura Nohr> You'd probably have out rain barrels. This would be only drinking water you'd carry. But even then, can you imagine, all that drinking water.

273
0:27:47.000 --> 0:27:50.000
<v Bob Neal> Yes. That'd be, that'd be a lot I suppose.

274
0:27:50.000 --> 0:27:55.000
<v Laura Nohr> What did you carry it in? Just an ordinary pail?

275
0:27:55.000 --> 0:27:59.000
<v Mrs Jacka> mm hmmm.
<v Laura Nohr> One in each hand? One pail in each hand?

276
0:27:59.000 --> 0:28:00.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh, I suppose.

277
0:28:00.000 --> 0:28:05.000
<v Laura Nohr> Who used to do it? The children? Or did the whole family go?

278
0:28:05.000 --> 0:28:14.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well Dad did a lot of it. I've heard mother say how early he used to get up in the morning to go to carry water.

279
0:28:14.000 --> 0:28:25.000
<v Bob Neal> Okay. When you were, um, a youngster, Mrs Jacka, did you ever go around and pick up float lead after it rained? You know, go around and pick up the little pieces of lead.

280
0:28:25.000 --> 0:28:31.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah, I'd put it in a can and take it to the grocery store and sell 'em.

281
0:28:31.000 --> 0:28:32.000
<v Bob Neal> All the kids used to do that, didn't they?

282
0:28:32.000 --> 0:28:36.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah.

283
0:28:36.000 --> 0:28:38.000
<v Bob Neal> Where, what store would you take it to?

284
0:28:38.000 --> 0:28:44.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, we'd take it to where Jeuck's are now.

285
0:28:44.000 --> 0:28:51.000
<v Bob Neal> Oh, that'd be old Mr Jeuck? Or that'd be before that. You remember,

286
0:28:51.000 --> 0:28:54.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh yes, before Jeuck.
<v Bob Neal> You remember the old storekeeper's name?

287
0:28:54.000 --> 0:28:57.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, I think the name was Lanyon.

288
0:28:57.000 --> 0:29:10.000
<v Bob Neal> Lanyon. Well, I know that used to be a favorite way for kids to earn money after a rainstorm to walk around with a syrup pail and pick up these little chunks of lead.

289
0:29:10.000 --> 0:29:13.000
<v Mrs Jacka> It was a can, had it in a can

290
0:29:13.000 --> 0:29:18.000
<v Bob Neal> Yeah, that was a favorite way of earning money.

291
0:29:18.000 --> 0:29:22.000
<v Laura Nohr> What would you do? Trade it in on candy right away?

292
0:29:22.000 --> 0:29:23.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, pretty quick.

293
0:29:23.000 --> 0:29:26.000
<v Bob Neal> Rock candy?

294
0:29:26.000 --> 0:29:28.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Mostly stick candy.

295
0:29:28.000 --> 0:29:35.000
<v Bob Neal> Oh, stick candy. Did you ever get rock candy? You know, that crystal rock candy with the string to it.

296
0:29:35.000 --> 0:29:40.000
<v Laura Nohr> Like Metz used to sell that rock candy when we were kids growing up. I used to buy it.

297
0:29:40.000 --> 0:29:42.000
<v Bob Neal> and so did

298
0:29:42.000 --> 0:29:43.000
<v Laura Nohr> It lasted a long time,

299
0:29:43.000 --> 0:29:49.000
<v Bob Neal> And so did, Will Bliss, always had rock candy.

300
0:29:49.000 --> 0:29:54.000
<v Edgar Hellum> If I got any money. I got a chunk of that. And of course it was so hard.

301
0:29:54.000 --> 0:29:55.000
<v Laura Nohr> Yes. But it lasted.

302
0:29:55.000 --> 0:30:02.000
<v Edgar Hellum> It was nothing but just pure crystallized sugar.

303
0:30:02.000 --> 0:30:12.000
<v Laura Nohr> Yeah. You used to go fishing and picnicking and picking flowers down below the zinc furnace, too. Didn't you? A lot you were growing up.

304
0:30:12.000 --> 0:30:14.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Picking flowers, I should say.

305
0:30:14.000 --> 0:30:23.000
<v Bob Neal> Do you remember the old zinc works down by the mile crossing? The old, the old Bellevue zinc works.

306
0:30:23.000 --> 0:30:25.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Would that be, Spensleys?

307
0:30:25.000 --> 0:30:28.000
<v Bob Neal> No, no, down the railroad track.

308
0:30:28.000 --> 0:30:30.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh, well we wouldn't go too far down there.

309
0:30:30.000 --> 0:30:31.000
<v Bob Neal> You know where the mile crossing is?

310
0:30:31.000 --> 0:30:39.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Mmm Hmmm.
<v Bob Neal> down. The old, old Matthison and Hegler zinc works used to be down there.

311
0:30:39.000 --> 0:30:42.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah, but we wouldn't go down, that far.

312
0:30:42.000 --> 0:30:43.000
<v Bob Neal> Didn't go that far.

313
0:30:43.000 --> 0:30:48.000
<v Mrs Jacka> mm mmm.
<v Laura Nohr> That's down where the bridge is. You know,

314
0:30:48.000 --> 0:31:01.000
<v Bob Neal> I don't, uh, uh, I've got a, uh, uh, a pencil drawing of the old Matthison and Hegler zinc works, but I've never found anyone that, that remembers anything about it.

315
0:31:01.000 --> 0:31:03.000
<v Laura Nohr> Is there a date on it?

316
0:31:03.000 --> 0:31:11.000
<v Bob Neal> Yes, there is, but I can't, I can't remember exactly the, the date to quote it now.

317
0:31:11.000 --> 0:31:12.000
<v Laura Nohr> It'd be over a hundred years ago now.

318
0:31:12.000 --> 0:31:20.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, could be Gilly Bennett would have probably known.

319
0:31:20.000 --> 0:31:36.000
<v Mrs Jacka> It's funny, I can remember about Klais don't you know? I can see that stocky little old fellow and that's all I do remember just seeing him molding it with his hands.

320
0:31:36.000 --> 0:31:55.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, I'd like to, uh, he must have made other things, different shaped pots and crocks for, uh, for keeping the preserves or lard or, or, uh, did he make flower pots, too? I imagine he did.

321
0:31:55.000 --> 0:32:01.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, they were, that red clay, you know.

322
0:32:01.000 --> 0:32:09.000
<v Bob Neal> Well don't you think that in order to get them round that he'd have a, a, a table that would revolve?

323
0:32:09.000 --> 0:32:12.000
<v Mrs Jacka> He had a form, don't you know.

324
0:32:12.000 --> 0:32:17.000
<v Bob Neal> then he shaped them, as they turned around, he shaped them with his hand is the thing spun on the table.

325
0:32:17.000 --> 0:32:20.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, maybe I didn't get to see him before that.

326
0:32:20.000 --> 0:32:32.000
<v Bob Neal> They generally have, they used to have a foot pedal, like a something like a sewing machine pedal that kept this geared to this revolving table and as it spun,

327
0:32:32.000 --> 0:32:37.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I thought of that name. Hitchens. Hitchens' Spring.

328
0:32:37.000 --> 0:32:47.000
<v Bob Neal> Hitchens' Spring. Well I've heard the name of Hitchens. Mrs Hitchen lived there in that old house, then.

329
0:32:47.000 --> 0:32:50.000
<v Mrs Jacka> That was Hitchens' Spring.

330
0:32:50.000 --> 0:33:04.000
<v Bob Neal> I'll have to bring up uh, an old photograph album that I've got that's got a picture of that house in it maybe that'd uh, remind you of what it was when you were a girl there.

331
0:33:04.000 --> 0:33:08.000
<v Mrs Jacka> and that water was just as clear as could be

332
0:33:08.000 --> 0:33:12.000
<v Bob Neal> Good water?

333
0:33:12.000 --> 0:33:20.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Mmm hmmm.
<v Bob Neal> Well lets see, if you were five or six years old, that would be what?

334
0:33:20.000 --> 0:33:24.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I suppose maybe that was what took me up to Klais's, was getting water from Hitchens' Spring.

335
0:33:24.000 --> 0:33:33.000
<v Bob Neal> '78, '79.
<v Mrs Jacka> 'Cause you'd have to go kind of down around there to get it.

336
0:33:33.000 --> 0:33:46.000
<v Bob Neal> Do you remember anybody that lived in that little red brick house there where Jimmy Mitchell used to live? It was torn down some years ago. The Grays used to live in there. Jack?

337
0:33:46.000 --> 0:33:49.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No, I don't remember any name.

338
0:33:49.000 --> 0:33:55.000
<v Bob Neal> And then there was a double row, two rock houses together.

339
0:33:55.000 --> 0:34:00.000
<v Mrs Jacka> There were some German women.

340
0:34:00.000 --> 0:34:26.000
<v Bob Neal> German women. Did you know that Mrs,.uh, Ingles that, uh, lived, that old lady that lived with Mrs. Henry Kaufman? She lived over there in uh, in that house next to Klais's, we know Charlie Noble's house, she lived the house this side. She was quite an elderly lady. I think she came out here from Chicago.

341
0:34:26.000 --> 0:34:31.000
<v Mrs Jacka> They were a couple of German women. They used to go out washing.

342
0:34:31.000 --> 0:34:36.000
<v Bob Neal> The only people I remember going out washing was Minnie Cridge.

343
0:34:36.000 --> 0:34:40.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah. Well that was later,

344
0:34:40.000 --> 0:34:43.000
<v Bob Neal> And n****r. Maryanne,

345
0:34:43.000 --> 0:34:45.000
<v Bob Neal> What was her.

346
0:34:45.000 --> 0:34:49.000
<v Laura Nohr> Miller, Maryann Miller.

347
0:34:49.000 --> 0:34:57.000
<v Bob Neal> Mary Ann Miller. They said she used to sit there by her little, uh, in her doorway over in her little cabin there and sing. Do you ever hear her sing?

348
0:34:57.000 --> 0:35:02.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Mmm hmmm.
<v Bob Neal> see, did she, what did she have? A guitar or a banjo or something?

349
0:35:02.000 --> 0:35:05.000
<v Mrs Jacka> no, she never played an instrument.

350
0:35:05.000 --> 0:35:07.000
<v Bob Neal> Just just sang by herself?

351
0:35:07.000 --> 0:35:13.000
<v Mrs Jacka> mmm hmmm.
<v Bob Neal> What would she sing? A color or a ?

352
0:35:13.000 --> 0:35:17.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Colored songs.
<v Bob Neal> Colored songs? Uh, uh, what are they called?

353
0:35:17.000 --> 0:35:25.000
<v Laura Nohr> Negro spirituals?
<v Bob Neal> A spiritual sort of thing. Did she have a nice voice?

354
0:35:25.000 --> 0:35:28.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, it was a colored voice.
<v Bob Neal> Yeah.

355
0:35:28.000 --> 0:35:34.000
<v Laura Nohr> Did you ever, did you see much of Marianne?

356
0:35:34.000 --> 0:35:37.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, when I knew her, most of her, she was out working.

357
0:35:37.000 --> 0:35:41.000
<v Laura Nohr> You don't ever remember her growing up here?

358
0:35:41.000 --> 0:35:44.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Up at Aunt Sally's is mostly what I remember.

359
0:35:44.000 --> 0:35:48.000
<v Laura Nohr> All right. Did she grow up here?

360
0:35:48.000 --> 0:35:52.000
<v Bob Neal> What?
<v Laura Nohr> Did she grow up here? Mary Ann.
<v Bob Neal> I don't know.
<v Laura Nohr> I don't either.
<v Bob Neal> Oh, you don't? I have a faint recollection of her don't you?

361
0:35:52.000 --> 0:35:54.000
<v Laura Nohr> Oh yes, I remember her.

362
0:35:54.000 --> 0:35:57.000
<v Bob Neal> And I can't remember Fanny Toby.

363
0:35:57.000 --> 0:36:08.000
<v Laura Nohr> You see, I probably remember her because my coming to school and she would come from that way and I very often met her. Don't you remember Fanny Toby?

364
0:36:08.000 --> 0:36:12.000
<v Bob Neal> Do you remember? You remember Fanny Toby, Mrs Jacka.

365
0:36:12.000 --> 0:36:19.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Mmm hmm.
<v Bob Neal> Uh, and then was there a colored family in town here by the name of Wasley?

366
0:36:19.000 --> 0:36:20.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Was that the name?

367
0:36:20.000 --> 0:36:29.000
<v Bob Neal> Was there a Dave Wasley? Colored?

368
0:36:29.000 --> 0:36:31.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I can't recall the name myself.

369
0:36:31.000 --> 0:36:35.000
<v Bob Neal> Wasley, Wasley and then a.

370
0:36:35.000 --> 0:36:39.000
<v Laura Nohr> Dodge Toby Dodge,
<v Bob Neal> Dodge, Dodge.

371
0:36:39.000 --> 0:36:48.000
<v Bob Neal> They must have been, uh, uh, well you can call them slaves. They took Governor Dodge's name.

372
0:36:48.000 --> 0:36:55.000
<v Laura Nohr> Must have been.
<v Bob Neal> He came up here with ah with the colored people from the South when he came here.

373
0:36:55.000 --> 0:36:57.000
<v Laura Nohr> mmm hmmm

374
0:36:57.000 --> 0:37:00.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Effie, well, uh, Effie Early you're thinking about.

375
0:37:00.000 --> 0:37:04.000
<v Laura Nohr> Well, no, but she is another one.

376
0:37:04.000 --> 0:37:16.000
<v Bob Neal> Yeah, Effie Early, too. Lets see, what were the Negro families here in town. There's the Dodges and the Tobys, and um, and n****r Mary Ann Miller.

377
0:37:16.000 --> 0:37:22.000
<v Mrs Jacka> And the Earlys.
<v Bob Neal> And the Earlys. And I thought there was a Wasley.

378
0:37:22.000 --> 0:37:23.000
<v Laura Nohr> I don't know about them.

379
0:37:23.000 --> 0:37:43.000
<v Bob Neal> I thought there was a Wasley. But they were the only ones that I've ever known about it.

380
0:37:43.000 --> 0:37:52.000
<v Laura Nohr> It's too bad we don't know who this lady is. Well, you don't have any idea, where you picked this picture up?

381
0:37:52.000 --> 0:37:55.000
<v Bob Neal> I don't have any idea. I don't have any.

382
0:37:55.000 --> 0:38:01.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I betcha Bertha didn't know who that was. She was just talking to you about the frame.

383
0:38:01.000 --> 0:38:02.000
<v Bob Neal> No, I put it in that frame.

384
0:38:02.000 --> 0:38:07.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh.

385
0:38:07.000 --> 0:38:12.000
<v Laura Nohr> We were looking at a group of pictures out there that day that it was with, I wonder,

386
0:38:12.000 --> 0:38:16.000
<v Bob Neal> well,
<v Laura Nohr> I mean it was in a big box that you brought out.

387
0:38:16.000 --> 0:38:27.000
<v Bob Neal> I should remember and should mark down where I get those things, now how I happen to come by that picture, I don't know. I don't know whether it was, lets see, would that have.

388
0:38:27.000 --> 0:38:34.000
<v Laura Nohr> We looked at pictures from Wheatons out there, that day.

389
0:38:34.000 --> 0:38:39.000
<v Bob Neal> Yes. Yes. I don't know if that would have come from Amy Masten's or not.

390
0:38:39.000 --> 0:38:41.000
<v Laura Nohr> And we looked at pictures from Amy Masten, too.

391
0:38:41.000 --> 0:38:45.000
<v Bob Neal> But then of course I've had so many other sources of, uh, of pictures.

392
0:38:45.000 --> 0:38:53.000
<v Laura Nohr> But I thought this was with one of the boxes of pictures that you brought out to us when we were.

393
0:38:53.000 --> 0:38:56.000
<v Bob Neal> You remember the Lutie family?

394
0:38:56.000 --> 0:39:01.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Who?
<v Laura Nohr> The Lutie family.

395
0:39:01.000 --> 0:39:02.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh, yes. He was sexton at the school.

396
0:39:02.000 --> 0:39:10.000
<v Bob Neal> There were quite a few girls weren't there?

397
0:39:10.000 --> 0:39:18.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, there was one that went with Charlie Grange.
<v Bob Neal> I was always under the impression that two of the Lutie girls went out to Hawaii and,

398
0:39:18.000 --> 0:39:37.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, they went west.
<v Bob Neal> or sort of a salvation army or, or some kind of missionary work. I've got a picture, I think of a, of boy, I don't know. There was four girls and maybe their mother and I've always understood that that was the Lutie family.

399
0:39:37.000 --> 0:39:41.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Tommy Lutie.

400
0:39:41.000 --> 0:39:43.000
<v Bob Neal> Tommy Lutie.

401
0:39:43.000 --> 0:39:46.000
<v Bob Neal> Where did they live?

402
0:39:46.000 --> 0:39:53.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Well, they lived about right in there where they built the high school, in there some place.

403
0:39:53.000 --> 0:39:58.000
<v Bob Neal> The present high school? Or the ah or the ah grade school?

404
0:39:58.000 --> 0:40:00.000
<v Mrs Jacka> The present high school.

405
0:40:00.000 --> 0:40:06.000
<v Bob Neal> The present high school. Tommy Lutie.

406
0:40:06.000 --> 0:40:07.000
<v Laura Nohr> Did they have a large family?

407
0:40:07.000 --> 0:40:08.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh, I don't think so.

408
0:40:08.000 --> 0:40:11.000
<v Laura Nohr> What did he do? Work at the zinc furnace too, then?

409
0:40:11.000 --> 0:40:15.000
<v Bob Neal> No. You said, what did you say Mrs Jacka? He was.

410
0:40:15.000 --> 0:40:20.000
<v Mrs Jacka> He was, he was.
<v Laura Nohr> Oh, sexton.
<v Mrs Jacka> Sexton at the school.

411
0:40:20.000 --> 0:40:21.000
<v Bob Neal> As we'd say now,

412
0:40:21.000 --> 0:40:22.000
<v Mrs Jacka> He used to ring the bell.

413
0:40:22.000 --> 0:40:23.000
<v Bob Neal> janitor.

414
0:40:23.000 --> 0:40:24.000
<v Laura Nohr> When you went to school was he the sexton?

415
0:40:24.000 --> 0:40:29.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Mmm hmmm. When I was in the high school.

416
0:40:29.000 --> 0:40:42.000
<v Laura Nohr> Oh, is that right? What was that? You used to have some saying that they used to say about him? Something about good morning, Mr Lutie, or some little poem. You remember that?

417
0:40:42.000 --> 0:40:44.000
<v Mrs Jacka> He was an awful kind old chap.

418
0:40:44.000 --> 0:40:46.000
<v Laura Nohr> That's true. I remember you told me that.

419
0:40:46.000 --> 0:40:48.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Maybe.

420
0:40:48.000 --> 0:40:54.000
<v Laura Nohr> Some kind of a little poem you had.

421
0:40:54.000 --> 0:40:58.000
<v Bob Neal> To greet him?

422
0:40:58.000 --> 0:41:15.000
<v Laura Nohr> Something like that. You know, just like kids. You don't remember it, huh? ,

423
0:41:15.000 --> 0:41:31.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, they, uh, the Pesch family lived, uh, uh, across from the telephone office in that, in that well did she, uh, did Mrs. Bauer live there for, uh, uh, some number of years?

424
0:41:31.000 --> 0:41:40.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah, when she went to school.
<v Bob Neal> Her father, uh, boarded her out there and she lived and stayed there. I wonder, what was she, about 18, when she left Mineral Point?

425
0:41:40.000 --> 0:41:43.000
<v Mrs Jacka> That's what she said.

426
0:41:43.000 --> 0:42:01.000
<v Bob Neal> 18 years old. She went away to school. Well, she, she speaks of course, of the Jeucks and the Pesches.

427
0:42:01.000 --> 0:42:12.000
<v Mrs Jacka> The Jeucks lived where Clint lives.
<v Bob Neal> Do you remember any of the, uh, uh, Mathison or the Hegler family that used to live there where Clint lives?

428
0:42:12.000 --> 0:42:31.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No, you see we didn't
<v Bob Neal> One of the, uh, one of the, uh, uh, Mathison girls. Well, now, how do I get, Fannie Gilman's name comes to me in connection with, uh, one of the Mathison girls. I wonder if,

429
0:42:31.000 --> 0:42:35.000
<v Mrs Jacka> well, Fannie GIlman married a, one of those boys.

430
0:42:35.000 --> 0:42:45.000
<v Bob Neal> A Mathison or a Hegler? They were the ones,

431
0:42:45.000 --> 0:42:46.000
<v Mrs Jacka> A Mathison, I think.

432
0:42:46.000 --> 0:42:50.000
<v Bob Neal> They were the ones that had this old Bellevue zinc works that I mentioned a whole back.

433
0:42:50.000 --> 0:43:02.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh.
<v Bob Neal> And they lived where, you mentioned Clinton there and made me think that that's where the Mathison's lived. There's a fireplace in each end of this Uh,

434
0:43:02.000 --> 0:43:05.000
<v Mrs Jacka> you know the fireplaces down there.

435
0:43:05.000 --> 0:43:23.000
<v Bob Neal> One at each end of this long room and uh, uh, someone told me that they used to have a glass, two glass chandeliers for candles hung in the, in the center of this great big, what was it, a ballroom.

436
0:43:23.000 --> 0:43:28.000
<v Mrs Jacka> The library used to be there when they first had it. The public library.

437
0:43:28.000 --> 0:43:29.000
<v Bob Neal> Upstairs there?

438
0:43:29.000 --> 0:43:32.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No downstairs. Yeah,

439
0:43:32.000 --> 0:43:36.000
<v Bob Neal> Downstairs. The old, the old early library.

440
0:43:36.000 --> 0:43:40.000
<v Mrs Jacka> The first they had.
<v Bob Neal> Who was the, uh, who was the librarian then?

441
0:43:40.000 --> 0:43:43.000
<v Mrs Jacka> I think Mrs. Chase.

442
0:43:43.000 --> 0:43:46.000
<v Bob Neal> Mrs. March Chase.

443
0:43:46.000 --> 0:43:48.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Mm hmm. That's why they said the books were all so dirty.

444
0:43:48.000 --> 0:43:55.000
<v Laura Nohr> Dirty? Oh dear.

445
0:43:55.000 --> 0:43:57.000
<v Bob Neal> Why were they all so dirty?

446
0:43:57.000 --> 0:44:02.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Because she was always so dirty.

447
0:44:02.000 --> 0:44:05.000
<v Laura Nohr> Mrs. Chase?

448
0:44:05.000 --> 0:44:07.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Oh, kind of.
<v Bob Neal> I wouldn't, you wouldn't think.

449
0:44:07.000 --> 0:44:11.000
<v Laura Nohr> No.

450
0:44:11.000 --> 0:44:17.000
<v Mrs Jacka> No you wouldn't think it.
<v Bob Neal> Did I tell you that I saw Katherine Chase last year in Chicago?

451
0:44:17.000 --> 0:44:18.000
<v Laura Nohr> No.

452
0:44:18.000 --> 0:44:31.000
<v Bob Neal> She lives in Hammond, Indiana and she was, uh, she happened to be up to Chicago, so I had a chance to visit with her. She hasn't been back here in years. Do you remember her?

453
0:44:31.000 --> 0:44:39.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Yeah.
<v Bob Neal> Kate Chase. She married some, I think his name was Sam Higgins?

454
0:44:39.000 --> 0:44:41.000
<v Laura Nohr> No, I wouldn't remember.

455
0:44:41.000 --> 0:44:47.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, I wouldn't either. I of course don't even remember Reverend and Mrs. Chase.

456
0:44:47.000 --> 0:44:53.000
<v Mrs Jacka> Did Edgar come?
<v Laura Nohr> Yah, um hmm. Did Edgar come, she said.

457
0:44:53.000 --> 0:45:22.000
<v Bob Neal> This recording up to this point was um, done with Mrs Dave Jacka who was Agnes Chamley, and her daughter, Laura Jacka Nohr. Laura, how old is your mother?

458
0:45:22.000 --> 0:45:28.000
<v Laura Nohr> Mother is 88. She was 88 the 19th of January.

459
0:45:28.000 --> 0:45:47.000
<v Bob Neal> This is just to confirm some of the dates and statements that she made and to give a time setting on some of the recollections.

460
0:45:47.000 --> 0:46:19.000
<v Bob Neal> Ah there's a correction. I want to make. Lizzie Terill and young Mark Terrell's mother was a Rablin. In other words, old Mrs. Mark Terrell Sr was a Rablin. I'm mistaken when I mentioned it being Mrs Will Terrill.

461
0:46:19.000 --> 0:46:23.000
<v Bob Neal> Aunt Etta, your birthday is when? Wednesday? How old are you going to be?

462
0:46:23.000 --> 0:46:25.000
<v Etta Neal> 89.

463
0:46:25.000 --> 0:46:27.000
<v Bob Neal> 89.

464
0:46:27.000 --> 0:46:29.000
<v Etta Neal> Pretty near 90.

465
0:46:29.000 --> 0:46:35.000
<v Bob Neal> Pretty near 90. When did you start teaching school?

466
0:46:35.000 --> 0:46:37.000
<v Etta Neal> Oh, dear, I don't know.
<v Bob Neal> Do you remember what year?

467
0:46:37.000 --> 0:46:41.000
<v Etta Neal> Oh, are you, you're not going to write that part?

468
0:46:41.000 --> 0:46:50.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, can't you tell me?

469
0:46:50.000 --> 0:46:55.000
<v Etta Neal> Uh, I graduated in '86.

470
0:46:55.000 --> 0:47:08.000
<v Bob Neal> In '86?
<v Etta Neal> Uh huh.
<v Bob Neal> And you started started teaching the next year. Then when did you finish? When did you quit teaching?

471
0:47:08.000 --> 0:47:10.000
<v Etta Neal> '57.

472
0:47:10.000 --> 0:47:16.000
<v Bob Neal> No, '37 probably.

473
0:47:16.000 --> 0:47:33.000
<v Bob Neal> You finished in '86 and when did you quit teaching then?

474
0:47:33.000 --> 0:47:45.000
<v Etta Neal> Oh, I can't think of. No, '37 '37.

475
0:47:45.000 --> 0:47:51.000
<v Bob Neal> 1937. Did you ever teach? Um, a first grade?

476
0:47:51.000 --> 0:47:55.000
<v Etta Neal> Oh yes, I supervised.

477
0:47:55.000 --> 0:48:03.000
<v Bob Neal> Howard Weisen said he thought you taught first grade? with Miss Jacka. Miss Jacka taught second grade.

478
0:48:03.000 --> 0:48:14.000
<v Etta Neal> Well, we taught together, but um, I should , well, we both teach

479
0:48:14.000 --> 0:48:15.000
<v Bob Neal> Which Miss Jacka was that?

480
0:48:15.000 --> 0:48:19.000
<v Etta Neal> Laura. You don't know her, I guess.

481
0:48:19.000 --> 0:48:28.000
<v Bob Neal> That was in the fourth ward school, but when you started teaching, did you teach first grade or second grade?

482
0:48:28.000 --> 0:48:29.000
<v Etta Neal> Taught first.

483
0:48:29.000 --> 0:48:30.000
<v Bob Neal> Taught first.

484
0:48:30.000 --> 0:48:33.000
<v Etta Neal> I guess.
<v Bob Neal> Then when did you switch over to second?

485
0:48:33.000 --> 0:48:52.000
<v Etta Neal> Well, I don't know, we worked together, you know. They would pass from room to room.

486
0:48:52.000 --> 0:49:09.000
<v Bob Neal> Did you ever teach in country school? You teach out in country school first? Before you came in town. Who's that?

487
0:49:09.000 --> 0:49:15.000
<v Etta Neal> I can't see it. Can't see it at all.
<v Bob Neal> Who is that then?

488
0:49:15.000 --> 0:49:18.000
<v Etta Neal> That's grandfather. Grandfather Rogers.

489
0:49:18.000 --> 0:49:21.000
<v Bob Neal> Grandfather Rogers.
<v Etta Neal> I gave that to your dad.

490
0:49:21.000 --> 0:49:22.000
<v Bob Neal> That's your mother's father.

491
0:49:22.000 --> 0:49:28.000
<v Etta Neal> Um hmm. Didn't you know who it was?

492
0:49:28.000 --> 0:49:38.000
<v Charles Neal> I didn't know who it was.
<v Etta Neal> Awww.

493
0:49:38.000 --> 0:49:44.000
<v Bob Neal> Is that Clark? Is it somebody who was in business with Grandpa Neal?

494
0:49:44.000 --> 0:49:52.000
<v Etta Neal> I can't see that one.

495
0:49:52.000 --> 0:50:05.000
<v Edgar Hellum> What time did you leave Milwaukee? Half past nine? You did. Did you come right straight out. You did? What time did they get here, Carol?

496
0:50:05.000 --> 0:50:07.000
<v Carol> About eleven o'clock.
<v Edgar Hellum> Do you have a nice ride out, Debbie?

497
0:50:07.000 --> 0:50:10.000
<v Debbie> Uh huh.
<v Edgar Hellum> Who drove?

498
0:50:10.000 --> 0:50:13.000
<v Debbie> My father.
<v Edgar Hellum> He did? Does your mother drive a car?

499
0:50:13.000 --> 0:50:16.000
<v Debbie> Yes.
<v Edgar Hellum> She does. She didn't drive today.

500
0:50:16.000 --> 0:50:19.000
<v Debbie> No.
<v Edgar Hellum> How come?

501
0:50:19.000 --> 0:50:26.000
<v Debbie> It was too busy on the road.
<v Edgar Hellum> Was there lots of traffic on the road. How did Johnny like the ride?

502
0:50:26.000 --> 0:50:33.000
<v Debbie> Oh, fine.
<v Edgar Hellum> Carol, did you get your camera to work?

503
0:50:33.000 --> 0:50:36.000
<v Carol> Yes.
<v Edgar Hellum> Did you get it fixed? What was the matter with it?

504
0:50:36.000 --> 0:50:37.000
<v Carol> Nothing. We just had to put a film in it.

505
0:50:37.000 --> 0:50:46.000
<v Etta Neal> Toay. This is Toay.

506
0:50:46.000 --> 0:50:48.000
<v Bob Neal> What was his first name?

507
0:50:48.000 --> 0:50:52.000
<v Etta Neal> Grandfather?

508
0:50:52.000 --> 0:50:58.000
<v Bob Neal> Yeah. John? Richard?

509
0:50:58.000 --> 0:50:59.000
<v Etta Neal> Dick.

510
0:50:59.000 --> 0:51:04.000
<v Bob Neal> Well, it must be Richard Rogers then.

511
0:51:04.000 --> 0:51:11.000
<v Etta Neal> Maybe it was.
<v Bob Neal> And what was your, what was your grandmother's name?

512
0:51:11.000 --> 0:51:15.000
<v Etta Neal> I don't know.
<v Bob Neal> Do you know dad?

513
0:51:15.000 --> 0:51:20.000
<v Charles Neal> Before my time.
<v Bob Neal> Well, I thought you probably would have heard them say.

514
0:51:20.000 --> 0:51:52.000
<v Conger Neal> Some family isn't it, when you can't find out anything. Was looking in the paper the other day and there was a picture in there of a bunch of people of the name of Neal I had never heard of. There seems to be more Neals in Milwaukee now than there ever have been. A lot of them are black, Negros.

515
0:51:52.000 --> 0:52:24.000
<v Charles Neal> Mother had one brother. He went out to the gold rush, to California.
<v Etta Neal> And Ann. His oldest girl was Ann.
<v Bob Neal> Benjamin. Wasn't that his name?

516
0:52:24.000 --> 0:52:35.000
<v Etta Neal> Yes.
<v Bob Neal> Grandma's, your Aunt Jane.
<v Etta Neal> Yes, that was Will Les' mother
<v Bob Neal> Will Les' mother. And Aunt Ann. Who were Aunt Ann's children?
<v Etta Neal> Well, there were a lot of them out there. Aunt Ann
<v Bob Neal> She was first married to Markham?

517
0:52:35.000 --> 0:52:40.000
<v Etta Neal> Yes.
<v Bob Neal> And Charlie Markham was the only child?

518
0:52:40.000 --> 0:52:47.000
<v Etta Neal> I think so.
<v Bob Neal> What about Lucy Strong? She was a Markham.

519
0:52:47.000 --> 0:52:53.000
<v Etta Neal> They were some relation.

520
0:52:53.000 --> 0:52:58.000
<v Bob Neal> Then what about, there was a Susan? What was her name?

521
0:52:58.000 --> 0:53:00.000
<v Etta Neal> Press.
<v Bob Neal> Where did they live?
<v Etta Neal> Savannah.

522
0:53:00.000 --> 0:53:06.000
<v Bob Neal> Any other sisters.

523
0:53:06.000 --> 0:53:27.000
<v Etta Neal> Yes, Alice.
<v Bob Neal> Where was she? Who was she? Did she marry? What her name?

524
0:53:27.000 --> 0:53:31.000
<v Etta Neal> She married your grandfather Neal and then she died.

525
0:53:31.000 --> 0:53:42.000
<v Bob Neal> And then Grandpa Neal married her sister, Mary, your mother.

526
0:53:42.000 --> 0:53:55.000
<v Etta Neal> I guess so. I don't know.
<v Bob Neal> And then just one brother. Benjamin. He's the one that went to California at the time of the gold rush. Did you ever hear from him after he left?

527
0:53:55.000 --> 0:54:03.000
<v Etta Neal> No.
<v Bob Neal> I thought Dad said they had one letter?

528
0:54:03.000 --> 0:54:17.000
<v Etta Neal> No, I don't think. I don't know.

529
0:54:17.000 --> 0:54:22.000
<v Bob Neal> They had one letter from him.
<v Charles Neal> That's what I was given to understand.

530
0:54:22.000 --> 0:54:24.000
<v Bob Neal> did you say Aunt Etta? They had one letter.

531
0:54:24.000 --> 0:54:34.000
<v Etta Neal> No.
<v Bob Neal> Never heard from him after he went out West?

532
0:54:34.000 --> 0:54:50.000
<v Charles Neal> Well I heard, somebody told me, they had one letter and that was the end. They never.
<v Bob Neal> What year did he go out there?

533
0:54:50.000 --> 
<v Charles Neal> The gold rush.
<v Etta Neal> '40s.
<v Charles Neal> '48 I guess it was.
<v Etta Neal> Somewhere around there.
