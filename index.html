        <h2>Interview: 1958 - Neal, Nohr, Jacka</h2>

        <p>Bob Neal talks with Laura Nohr and her mother Mrs. David Jacka (nee Agnes Chamley) in 1958; topics include Matilda Hood who was the first female European settler in Mineral Point, the tornado of 1878, the federal spring west of Shake Rag street, and the Klais pottery.</p>

        <p>The last ten minutes of the tape (starting at minute 46) record a conversation on March 31, 1958 with Bob and his extended family: aunt Etta Neal, father Charles Neal, brother Conger Neal and Congerâ€™s daughter Debbie. Edgar Hellum appears briefly in both interviews.</p>

        <p>The original reel to reel recordings were digitized by Dorothea Salo and the UW-Madison Recover Analog and Digital Data (RADD) project through a grant from Ira and Ineva Reilly Baldwin Wisconsin Idea Endowment.</p>
